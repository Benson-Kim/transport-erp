# Components Directory

React components organized by type and feature.

## Structure

- `/ui/` - Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, modals, etc.)
- `/features/` - Feature-specific components
- `/layouts/` - Layout wrapper components

## Guidelines

- One component per file
- Maximum 300 lines per component
- Export interfaces for all props
- Include JSDoc comments
